# Raycasting Game Engine

A raycasting game engine inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*, built with C and SDL.

![js-prototype](https://github.com/Nico-Posateri/c-and-js-raycast-engine/assets/141705409/f522b7d8-7144-4a0b-a7fa-3bf18a38a31e)
> [!NOTE]
> The C engines are not yet properly optimized for building a complete game.

## Directory Information
The **c-rcu-engine** folder will contain an improved C raycasting engine with custom textures and sprites for demo.

The **c-rc-engine** folder contains the base raycasting engine built with C. This engine uses [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5), as well as textures and sprites from **id Software's** 1992 classic, *Wolfenstein 3D*. This engine attempts to closely emulate the original game's engine, with the support of SDL2.

The **js-prototype** folder contains a prototype of the raycasting engine built with JavaScript, rendered in-browser.

## Additional Information
Again, the textures and sprites used in the **c-rc-engine** build are property of **id Software**.

The textures and sprites used in the **c-rcu-engine** build were made by myself, using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
