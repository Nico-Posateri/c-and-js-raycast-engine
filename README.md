> [!NOTE]
> The C engine is not yet properly optimized for building a complete game.

The **c-rc-engine** folder contains the complete raycasting engine built with C. This engine uses [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5).

The **js-prototype** folder contains a prototype of the raycasting engine built with JavaScript, rendered in-browser.
